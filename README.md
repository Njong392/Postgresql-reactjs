- To run this project locally, fork and then clone. 
- You can then run `npm install` in both the `frontend` and `backend` folders to install dependencies, and then use `npm run dev` to get the client side running on your browser (run this in your frontend folder). 
- In a separate terminal, navigate into the backend folder and run `node index` to start the server.
